# cookiecutter-pytest-plugin

[![Documentation Status][docs_badge]][documentation]

Minimal [Cookiecutter] template for authoring [pytest] plugins that help
you write better programs.

## Getting Started

Install [Cookiecutter] and generate a new pytest plugin project:

```no-highlight
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin
```

Cookiecutter prompts you for information regarding your plugin:

```no-highlight
full_name [Raphael Pierzina]: Andreas Pelme
email [raphael@hackebrot.de]: andreas@pelme.se
github_username [hackebrot]: pelme
plugin_name [foobar]: awesome
module_name [awesome]: awesome
short_description [A simple plugin to use with pytest]:
version [0.1.0]:
pytest_version [2.9.1]:
Select docs_tool:
1 - mkdocs
2 - sphinx
3 - none
Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 1
Select license:
1 - MIT
2 - BSD-3
3 - GNU GPL v3.0+
Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 2
INFO:post_gen_project:Moving files for mkdocs.
```

There you go - you just created a minimal pytest plugin:

```no-highlight
pytest-awesome/
├── LICENSE
├── README.rst
├── pyproject.toml
├── src
│   └── pytest_awesome
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── plugin.py
├── tests
│   ├── conftest.py
│   └── test_awesome.py
└── tox.ini
```


## Features

- Installable [PyPI] package featuring a `pyproject.toml`.
- Test suite running [tox] and [pytest] that makes sure your plugin is working
  as expected
- Working example code for a fixture, a cli option, as well as a pytest.ini
  option
- Comprehensive `README.rst` file that contains useful information about your
  plugin
- Continuous integration configuration for [GitHub Actions]
- Optional documentation with either [Sphinx] or [MkDocs]
- Choose from several licenses, such as [MIT], [BSD-3], [Apache v2.0], [GNU GPL
  v3.0+], or [MPL v2.0]
